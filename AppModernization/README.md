# Develper and Insight Days
## App Modernization Hack Event

### Overview
This hack is intended to be delivered over the course of a single day that walks through how one can migrate on-premises workloads using the 4-"R" options:
* Rehost
* Refactor
* Rearchitect
* Rebuild

The hack focuses on 3 common methods -- rehost, refactor and rearchitect using a 2-tier ASP.NET webform line-of-business (LOB) application connected to a SQL database. There is a small-amount of content available in the delivery slides to walk through the idea behind these migration paths as well as a primer on Azure PaaS capabilities and Containers.

Option: To save time; the instructor could pre-migrate the IaaS SQL database to Azure SQL DB and provide the connection string to the class to ensure the course material is able to be completed during the day 

### Resources
* [ARM Templates to build jump-box with Visual Studio for Lab](https://github.com/007FFFLearning/ADS-Containers/tree/master/Sources)
* [Self-Contained Web Application](./Application)
* [Azure Migration Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/contoso-migration-overview)

### Suggested Schedule
There is a fair amount of content to cover in a short period of time; the container session maybe challenging to complete but the attendees will be left with the material and guidance on how to complete once they leave.
